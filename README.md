This project analyzes two datasets: App store app reviews and play store app reviews. 
The main focus is to compare datasets for app reviews, price and user feedback. 
Results are implemented visually. 

Ideas for project:
Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on the reviews from both datasets to understand the overall sentiment of users towards the apps. You can compare the average sentiment scores between the two platforms or analyze sentiment trends over time.

Rating Distribution: Compare the distribution of ratings (e.g., 1-star, 2-star, etc.) between the two platforms. Are users more generous with their ratings on one platform compared to the other?

Word Frequency Analysis: Analyze the most common words or phrases used in the reviews on each platform. Are there any notable differences in the language used by users on the Apple App Store versus the Google Play Store?

App Category Analysis: Group the reviews by app category (e.g., Games, Productivity, Social Networking) and analyze if there are any differences in ratings or sentiments across categories between the two platforms.

Developer Analysis: Analyze the reviews based on the developers of the apps. Are there any developers who consistently receive higher or lower ratings on both platforms?

Correlation between Ratings and Review Length: Investigate if there's any correlation between the length of reviews and the ratings given by users on both platforms. Do longer reviews tend to have higher or lower ratings?

Time Series Analysis: Analyze how ratings and sentiments change over time for popular apps on both platforms. Are there any seasonal trends or events that impact user sentiment?

Price vs. Rating: Investigate if there's any correlation between the price of apps and their ratings on both platforms. Do users perceive higher-priced apps as being of higher quality?

User Engagement Analysis: Analyze metrics such as the number of reviews per app, the average length of reviews, or the frequency of updates to understand user engagement patterns on both platforms.

Cross-Platform Comparison: Identify apps that are available on both platforms and compare their ratings, sentiments, and user engagement metrics. Are there any differences in user perception between the two platforms for the same app?
